This project involves creating a dynamic weather application using HTML and CSS. The app displays real-time weather information, including temperature, humidity, and wind speed for a specified location. The user-friendly interface updates visuals, such as icons or background images, based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, snowy).

Key features include:

Responsive Design: The app is designed to be visually appealing and functional across various devices.
Weather Data Fetching: Utilizes an API to retrieve live weather data, ensuring the information is current.
Dynamic Imagery: Changes images based on weather conditions to enhance user experience.
User Input: Allows users to input their location to receive customized weather updates.
